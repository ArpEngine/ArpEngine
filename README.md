# ArpEngine

an abstract 2D game engine 

## What is this?

ArpEngine is a game engine primary focused on creating 2D RPGs.
Trivia: the name is chosen to sound like "RPG"

Focused on:

- Text based workflow
- Small start (prototyping with placeholder assets and enhance with "decorators")
- Structure based datawork (copy-paste your XML to create a new enemy)
- Basic features a 2D RPG would want (sprites, tilemaps, bitmap text, ordered map iterator)
- May use but do not necessarily depend on specific asset formats / libraries

Not so focused on:

- Being performant (not so SIMD / GPU / cache friendly)
- Being self-contained (you'll have to code some much)
- Online / Multiplayer
- Probably won't fit for a large project or team

## What is the state of this project?

Has gone through a private pilot project (completed, not translated to English)
Currently going through more internal dogfooding with many breaking fixes expected.

I cannot provide a sample project because this engine is too yet unstable. Sorry.
